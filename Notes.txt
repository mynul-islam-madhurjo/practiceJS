Variables
We use var for variable. Also we can use ""let"" and ""const"".

Data Types
We dont need to declare the data types for assiging the variables. We just use var keyword.
If we want to check the type of the variable we use "typeof" keyword.

String Operators 
What we use for combining strings with other type of operators. We use ""+"" for concatination.

Conditions 
We use "if , else" conditions for giving conditions. Also we can use "else if" condition.

Array 
We declare array by using []. We can put any kind of data type in the array. For example var a = [1,2,3];

Properties and Methods 
.length = Shows the the total length of the string.
.indexOf('value') = Shows the the index of the particular word or character.
.substring('index value', 'index value') = Shows the portion of the long string.
.replace('value')= It replaces the word with another word.
.toUpperCase() = It makes the string all upper case.
.reverse()= reverse the array.

Scopes
Scopes basically means where we can use variables. Global scope is declared in the root js file. Local scope is declared inside 
the function.


Function Scope & Block Scope 
Function scope is curly braces around the function and block scope is curly braces around the variable. We can acces block scope declared variable but can not acces function scope

let and const
var has a flow that it can be accesed from block scope. let fixed the issue. const is used when we dont want to change the variable.
